## What is this directory?

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is an excellent project, but I feel like there are some improvement points, such as certain styles and adopted libraries.

The common guidelines applied to all components are as follows:

- Use tailwind-variants instead of cva
  - Divide classnames into an array by category as much as possible for better readability
- Avoided using width/height styles as much as possible
- Do not export component details to reuse the same design principles
