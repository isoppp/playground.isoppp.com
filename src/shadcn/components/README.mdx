## What is this directory?

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is an excellent project, but I feel like there are some improvement points, such as certain styles and adopted libraries.

The common guidelines applied to all components are as follows:

- Use tailwind-variants instead of cva
  - Divide classnames into an array by category as much as possible for better readability
- Avoided using width/height styles as much as possible
- Medium/default size form components are adjusted based on a height of 38px.
- Do not export component details to reuse the same design principles
- Restrict which props can be passed to components

---

Roadmap:

I'm going to implement the following components following my needs since I don't need all components.

checked = implemented
unchecked = not implemented,
! = willing to implement / planned
? = consider when needed
x = not needed
